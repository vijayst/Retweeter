The Retweeter project was built to illustrate how to get push notifications working in a React native android app. In this project, we use Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) to send push notifications. The server infrastructure is built using AWS Lambda and AWS API Gateway.

A tutorial series is blogged in my website to explain how the app was built.
* [Part 1: Remote Push notifications in React Native for an Android app](https://vijayt.com/post/remote-push-notifications-in-react-native-android-app/)
* [Part 2: Sending push notifications via Firebase using AWS Lambda](https://vijayt.com/post/sending-push-notifications-via-firebase-using-aws-lambda/)
* [Part 3: Displaying data from push notification](https://vijayt.com/post/displaying-data-push-notification/)

The git repo will be slightly different from the tutorial. The [Retweeter app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vijayt.retweeter) is available in the Android Play Store.
